There are missions with Secondary objective where if said objective fails, you fail regardless of your survival such as Escort or Control missions.
Degree of failure exist but failure is a failure. **This mod replace those missions with approriate alternative mission.**

**Only applicable for Newly generated mission after the mod is enabled.**
Below missions can be disabled individually via MCM config menu.
- If escort is disabled, it will be will be replaced by Infiltration mission.
- If control is disabled, it will be will be replaced by Defense mission.
- If ritual is disabled (which is kind of like control), it will be will be replaced by Sabotage/Control mission. Works with Control mission disabling. (in which case it will be Sabotage/Defense)
**Need to restart the game after MCM config setup for this mod to take effect**

Somewhat a callback to simpler times when the game only needed you to survive to not lose.
